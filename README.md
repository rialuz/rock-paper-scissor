# Rock. Paper. Scissor. SHOOT!

Deployed at https://rock-paper-scissor-jet-kappa.vercel.app/

Play against a computer in this classic game of rock, paper, scissor.

I've always had an interest in creating games and have been practing and working on projects that are game related. It's not only fun to test and play, but it does keep me in shape with ensuring that I am applying proper game logic and an aesthically pleasing UI. 


### Future Work
- Unit testing
- Allow for local co-op
- SignUp/SignIn to enable users to view who they recently played with along with their scores.
